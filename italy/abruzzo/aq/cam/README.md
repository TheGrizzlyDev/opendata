Consorzio Acquedottistico Marsicano (C.A.M.) is the consurtium responsible for managing hydric resources within the Marsican territory. 

Most of its data is available in: https://www.cam-spa.com/pagina134564_il-consorzio.html

Sadly, most of the more interesting GEO data is available exclusively through low quality renderings (in jpeg). At least, these seemengly low quality renderings can at least be scaled up by changing one request parameter `larghezza` which is the number of pixel of the width of the image. The height will be automatically scaled accordingly.
